# About

This is my pet project. It's something I pick up whenever I get bored. To me,
what Nintendo and SGI did with this console is nothing short of amazing. The
ingenuity and design of the hardware was well-ahead of it's time, and it is
an absolute blast to reverse-engineer and study. I started this project in
order to learn more about what _really_ went on at the hardware level back in
the (good old) days.

That being said, I've also grown tired of people complaining that "cycle
accurate simulation on N-gen consoles is impossible." Not to be a bigot, but
no, it's not. Is it hard to write a simulator that is capable of running fast
enough to emulate a 93.75MHz processor on modern machines? Absolutely. Is it
impossible? No, certainly not. It just takes time. Programming is an art,
and like anything else, it takes time if done well.

Getting back on track: this simulator attempts to be everything that every
other emulator hoped to be, but never quite attained due to... emulation. My
hopes are that properly simulating things at the cycle and pixel-accurate level
will preserve the original fidelity of the work that so many companies put
out.

Thank you to every single one of you developers for filling my childhood
with excellent memories. I'd also like to thank the community on all their
hard work and effort spent reverse-engineering this little gem. Without
further ado...
